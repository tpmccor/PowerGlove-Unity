# PowerGlove-Unity
Unity scripts for controlling a hand model. Written for ECE 4960 in Fall 2020 for Clemson University.
This project was granted the Fall 2020 Design Excellence Award.  

This is not the full Unity project. This repository only holds scripts I contributed significantly to for the project.
